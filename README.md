Keep an eye on the tabs at the bottom to keep track of the game's progress. The message panel on the right logs information
roll-by-roll: it tells you whose turn it is, what round it is, what what was rolled, and what the outcome of the roll is. 
The 'Game Status' panel on the left keeps track of how many points each player scores in the current game and in the current round of that game.
